## What is BARO?
"BARO(바로)", derived from the Korean word meaning 'straight' or 'correct', embodies the essence of maintaining a properly aligned posture or physique.

Our application, "BARO", lives up to its name by assisting users in maintaining proper posture. Using pose estimation technology, it captures, measures, and analyzes the user's posture, providing assistance in maintaining a correct stance.

Our goal is to help users maintain proper posture, thereby detecting and alleviating problems such as spinal and neck pain. This aims to contribute to the users' overall well-being and productivity, as maintaining a correct posture is crucial, especially for those working long hours in a seated position.

## Goal
**Goal 3. Good Health and Well-Being**

## About
Our team has chosen Goal 3, `Good Health and Well-being`, from the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. This choice is due to the nature of GDSC, where many people aspire to be developers, and hence, have experienced neck pain from using computers for extended periods.

Upon searching related keywords via Google Trends, we noticed that the interest in this problem has been increasing as the digital age progresses. Notably, the search volume for keywords such as `neck pain` and `how to fix posture` has been growing in tandem, which made us realize the urgent need for a solution to this problem.

Therefore, our team has set out to solve this issue for people who work sitting for long hours, especially digital workers. By providing them with systematic health management methods, we aim to alleviate the problem of neck pain and contribute to the improvement of their quality of life caused by it.
